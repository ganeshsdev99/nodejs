when we write sync after the particular function name then we need to consider that the that line will be executed first and then after that other line will be executed as node js follows single thread pattern then it need to look into that part some imp functionality need to be executed as imp feature before it is run by 
node js is always a event driven architecture
asynchronous means it wont wait for other process to complete it

single thread,
event loop,
blocking code,


single javascript thread is been utilised 
single thread is able to handle the multiple response


event loop is automatically started by nidejs when we create the nodejs application
this is responsible for calling event handlebacks
handles only the which can be finished faster 


long taking operation is taken up by the worker pool
do heavy lifting
detached from the code
multi threading background


event loop:
is set by the nodejs which keep running in background until we give command of stop the process
it checks the time
it checks the pending callback

get into poll event where it expects the call backs from various other part or we can say it is ready to accept the new iput from the user
